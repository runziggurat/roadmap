# Ziggurat
> Our high-level roadmap of Ziggurat's features and business model

<!-- Tagline ideas:
“We are your networking spec”

## Description

TODO: Snappy description of Ziggurat

- IMO it's any useful tooling that you can create with a super lean node impl that can participate in a P2P network

## Business Case

- Benefits
  - Increased security
  - Increased performance
  - Increased visibility
  - Increased mooning


- “what does great tooling look like for building L1 infra"
- a set of tools useful for testing and introspecting a live network
- audit of a chain’s network stack
- IMO a set of tools to allow users of P2P nodes easily do 2 things which are often not feasible:
  - test their network features in isolation
  - integration-test their full nodes
- "we found security flaws and bugs in ZCash and so can you"
-  “battle testing a node’s network stack”
-  From a software perspective, the tooling is central to the idea imo: it doesn’t exist and we’re building it. From a business perspective, we’re auditing a node’s network stack, testing it and providing the means to introspect it when it’s deployed to mainnet/testnet/whatevernet.
- we could take advantage of the fact how scary network vulnerabilities are, picture an image of a malicious node browsing the whole network and then killing every node with a crafted message
- good testing = solid network = less issues = higher trust = more users = better return on whatever shitoken you’ve been promised in return for your $200m
- more TPS lmao
- so are we going to have a “ranking” on the website?
- we’d use “ziggurat best practices” checklist which if you hit, you just fly up the rankings

## Current Targets

- ZCash
- Polkadot

## The team

- Show our chops effectively (PRs? Projects?)

## Current Features (ZCash only) Ideas

### Test Network Features

-  the crawler
### Live Network Features

1. What ziggurat can do for you"
   -  Live network stuff
   - Test network stuff
2. Test Suite
   - Conformance to spec
   - Performance benchmarking
   - Resistance to malicious actions

## Future work

- Network crawler
- Network visualizer
- Management UI
- replay for small-scale devnets for debugging 
- Leaderboard for best performing networks (moar TPS)
- all kinds of integration tests and network measurements
- malicious actor testnet
- We could also spin up a network and have people red team it,
- Like can we create a service by which people can easily try to break the testnet themselves
- network testing for many different (as in different networks) nodes
- if we add a UI on top
- “a control center for your blockchain network”

# Business Model

1. Get support for your network
    - One time integration fee/grant
    - Continuous maintenance grant/staking delegation
